<strong>Fast, Easy, Beautiful: Pick Three - Building User Interfaces with GWT</strong>
<br/>
May  2007, Google Developer Day 2007 (in Mountain View)
<br/>
Bruce Johnson and Joel Webber
<blockquote>
The GWT is an open source Java-centric framework for creating AJAX applications. GWT cross-compiles Java source 
into  JavaScript, allowing Java developers to use their existing Java skills and tools to easily create AJAX applications with virtually 
no learning  curve. After a short introduction to GWT, we will dive quickly into a few key topics including high-performance AJAX, remote 
procedure calls,  and integration with existing web applications.

<strong>GWT Fireside Chat: Common Questions</strong>
<br/>
May  2007, Google Developer Day 2007 (in Mountain View)
<br/>
The GWT Team
<blockquote>
At Google Developer Day 2007, the GWT team hosted an open Q&A session. This presentation comprises some of the common questions 
we have heard regarding usage of GWT. We used these slides to kick-off the conversation."

<strong>Writing Big Apps with GWT</strong>
<br/>
March 2007, TheServerSide Java Symposium
<br/>
Bruce Johnson
<blockquote>
The session begins with a short introduction to GWT followed by a detailed explanation of GWT features and best 
practices for building large, multi-page AJAX applications.

<strong>GWT: Quick relief of AJAX pain (tutorial)</strong>
<br/>
March 2007, EclipseCon 2007
<br/>
Kelly Norton and Miguel Mendez
<blockquote>
AJAX applications are all the rage these days. And why not? They're simple to  use, accessible from anywhere, free of sneaky 
installers and generally safer  from the malware gremlins. But behind every good web app, there's a group of  exhausted AJAX developers 
driven to the brink of madness with worry of browser  quirks, memory leaks and load times. In this session, we'll build a small web  app 
and demonstrate how the GWT relieves the nervous twitching troubling AJAX developers by  allowing them to practice sound 
engineering using Java and Eclipse and still end up with fast, light-weight JavaScript applications.

<strong>A Business Case for Ajax with GWT</strong>
<br/>
October 2006, JAOO 2006
<br/>
Bruce Johnson
<blockquote>
The tricky thing about Ajax is this: in small quantities, it seems
great. Developers enjoy writing bits of client-side script, and users
love the extra interactivity. Everything is rosy...until those
individual small, elegant bits of JavaScript begin to accumulate and
interact unpredictably, turning your formerly well-architected web
application into an impenetrable mound of spaghetti script.
<br/><br/>
GWT stops spaghetti script before it starts by
making it possible for developers to write and debug Ajax applications
using the time-tested Java programming language and its rich ecosystem
of tools. By building your Ajax application out of reusable Java
classes, you help ensure that your Ajax investment leaves you with a
code base you're glad to have.

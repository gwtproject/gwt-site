GWT Name Use Policy
===================

Goals
-----
The purpose of this document is to define the brand and mark policies of the GWT Project, both how
the project's branding is done and how other projects may or may not use it. In general, it is our
goal to be as open and permissive as possible, recognizing that it is important to reserve some
mark to set aside parts of GWT itself from external projects and libraries (gwt-core, gwt-dev,
gwt-uibinder, gwt-rpc vs gwt-project, gwtp, ext gwt). That said, it is important to protect the
reputation and branding of GWT and GWT Project by making it clear what is part of the official
project and how GWT name should and should not be used. External projects that suggest that they are
an official part of the GWT Project might knowingly or unknowingly harm the greater community by
confusing the matter. The goal is not to prevent use of the term GWT, but to make sure that it is
clear when it refers to the core set of tools and libraries, versus the surrounding community of
libraries and frameworks.

Exceptions
----------
The policies defined in this document are meant to outline what is acceptable when using the name,
logo, or other marks of the GWT Project. It is not meant to clearly define what is not acceptable,
except to say that these things may not automatically be permissible. Any additional use not
approved in this document may still be okay, subject to approval by the GWT Steering Committee's
usual process.

Definitions
-----------
* [GWT](https://www.gwtproject.org/) - The product itself. GWT is a development toolkit for building
and optimizing complex browser-based applications. Its goal is to enable productive development of
high-performance web applications without the developer having to be an expert in browser quirks,
XMLHttpRequest and JavaScript.
* GWT Project - The greater process by which GWT is being developed - the documentation,
the contributors, groups and discussions.
* [GWT Steering Committee](steering.html) - a group of GWT contributors dedicated to the ongoing
success of the GWT Project, working together by consensus to guide the future of the project.

GWT Name use
------------
1.  Name is spelled **GWT** - all capital and it stands for **GWT Web Toolkit**. These are
    collectively referred as Name in this document.

    *Example: You can state on your website that My project X is based on GWT.*

2.  It is ok to use Name as a part of your product name as long as:
    - Name does not imply any status of being an official part of GWT or being endorsed by GWT.

    *Example: You may not name your product "Official GWT XML Bindings.*
    *Example: You should not name your product as "GWT Core", "GWT Framework" or "GWT Toolkit".*

    - Your product, organization or event name is not GWT, GWT Web Toolkit, GWT Project or it is not
      referred as GWT in short form.

    *Example: If your product would be named "GWT Foundation Server" you should not refer to it as
    "GWT" in your materials.*

3.  You should not imply that your project, domain name, product, organization or event is official
    part of GWT product or somehow endorsed by GWT project or GWT Steering Committee.

    *Example: You may not use statements like "GWT Steering Committee recommends product X" or
    "GWT2013 Conference is the official gathering of the GWT Project" in your materials.*

4.  Only projects being controlled by GWT Steering Committee are allowed to use **org.gwtproject**
    package name or maven groupid.

    *Example: It is ok to use com.myorganization.gwt.foo as a package name, but not
    org.gwtproject.myorganization.foo.*

5.  There is no preferential treatment for Name use by any of the organizations that are part of
    the GWT Steering Committee.

GWT Logo use
------------
1.  The official GWT logo (later GWT logo) is chosen by GWT Steering Committee.

2.  You may reproduce the GWT logo in your materials in order to refer to GWT or the GWT Project
    itself.

    *Example: You may include GWT logo in a technology stack picture representing that your product
    is built on top of or uses GWT.*

3.  You may use GWT logo to endorse GWT or the GWT project.

    *Example: You may print T-shirts, mugs and other merchandise with GWT logo.*

4.  You may not use GWT logo in a way that would be considered as an endorsement to you, your
    organization or project.

    *Example: You should not list GWT Logo on your website in the list of customers or partners.*

5.  You may not change the GWT logo or create a logo that would fail the "confusingly similar"
    or "likelihood of confusion" tests.

    *Example: You should not draw a GWT User Group X logo as a variation of the GWT logo by somehow
    changing the colors or shape of the logo. However, you may create GWT User Group X logo by
    adding a text "GWT User Group X" under the logo as showcased in the graphical guidelines below.*

6.  When you use GWT logo, you must follow the [graphical guidelines](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7xWXqwxUXt4T08yRW03ZDh2SEk) for logo use.

7. You can download [the logo from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7xWXqwxUXt4LXJtcXZFbmtUVDQ) in various formats.

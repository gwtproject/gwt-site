* Java8
    * Good progress in adding support. 
    * Need more tests for Java8: Soliciting contributions from community. 
* GWT 2.8
    * Main criteria: Get new Guava working with GWT 2.8 before releasing 2.8.
* Github issues
    * Being used regularly
    * Thomas is driving a plan to handle this better. Will wait for this to be finalized.
* Refresh of beta
    * Check how much work is left to be done to get guava building before deciding on this.
    * If 2.8 RC1 doesn’t look imminent, put out a new beta.

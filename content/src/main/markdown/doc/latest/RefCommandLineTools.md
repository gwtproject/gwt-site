Command Line Tools
===

The GWT includes a set of tools that can be run from the command-line to simplify and speed up common tasks.

1.  [Configuring Your Path](#ConfiguringYourPath)
2.  [webAppCreator](#webAppCreator)
3.  [i18nCreator](#i18nCreator)

## Configuring your PATH<a id="ConfiguringYourPath"></a>

To easily invoke the command-line tools without entering their full path names, add them to your system command search path.
To do this, in the PATH environment variable, identify the directory in which you unpacked the GWT distribution.

### Windows

1.  Right-click on _My Computer_ and select _Properties_
2.  Open the _Advanced_ tab.
3.  Click the _Environment Variables_ button.
4.  From the user variables list, select _Path_ and click _Edit_
5.  At the end of the of the variable value, add a semicolon followed by the full path to the directory where you unpacked the GWT distribution (e.g., `;C:\gwt-2.0.0\`).

### Mac or Linux

Edit a file named `.profile` or `.bash_profile` in your home directory.
For example, if you unpacked GWT in `/home/user/gwt-2.0.0/`, update your profile as follows:

```shell
PATH=$PATH:/home/user/gwt-2.0.0/
export PATH
```

You will need to log out of your account and log back in before the PATH setting takes effect.

## webAppCreator<a id="webAppCreator"></a>

A command-line tool that generates a starter application and scripts for launching [development mode](DevGuideCompilingAndDebugging.html#DevGuideDevMode) and [compiling to JavaScript](DevGuideCompilingAndDebugging.html#DevGuideJavaToJavaScriptCompiler).
Use the files generated by these scripts as a starting point for building your own project.

```text
    webAppCreator [-[no]overwriteFiles] [-[no]ignoreExistingFiles] \
                  [-templates template1,template2,...] [-out dir] \
                  [-junit pathToJUnitJar] [-[no]maven] [-[no]ant] moduleName
```

| Parameter                | Definition |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| -[no]overwriteFiles      | Overwrite any existing files. (defaults to OFF)
| -[no]ignoreExistingFiles | Ignore any existing files; do not overwrite. (defaults to OFF)
| -templates               | Specifies the template(s) to use (comma separeted). Defaults to 'sample,ant,eclipse,readme'
| -out                     | The directory to write output files into (defaults to current)
| -junit                   | Specifies the path to your junit.jar (optional)
| -[no]maven               | DEPRECATED: Create a maven2 project structure and pom file (default disabled). Equivalent to specifying 'maven' in the list of templates. (defaults to OFF)
| -[no]ant                 | DEPRECATED: Create an ant configuration file. Equivalent to specifying 'ant' in the list of templates. (defaults to OFF)
| moduleName               | The name of the module to create (e.g. com.example.myapp.MyApp)


### Examples

You can select either `ant` or `maven` build system. Based on your selection you will get a different build script, and a different folder structure.

Since nowadays Maven is widely used and importing maven projects in IDE is easier, it's better that you select it for your new GWT projects.

### Creating a `Maven` project.

```shell
webAppCreator -out foo -templates maven,sample,readme com.example.foo.Foo
```

The generated files are used as follows:

*   Running `mvn gwt:run` from the command-line brings up the new application in superDevMode.
*   Running `mvn package` from the command-line translates the Java app to JavaScript, creating a `war` file into the target directory.
*   The other files in src implement a small sample GWT application, with the appropriate `web.xml` file and tests.

_**Note**: because of a bug in GWT-2.7.0, it generates a broken `pom.xml`, hence, you have to modify the `<dependencyManagement>` block to include the `<type>` parameter:_

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- ensure all GWT deps use the same version (unless overridden) -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.gwt</groupId>
      <artifactId>gwt</artifactId>
      <version>${gwtVersion}</version>
      <scope>import</scope>
      <type>pom</type>
   </dependency>
 </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

### Creating an `Ant` project.

```shell
webAppCreator -junit /path/to/junit-3.8.1.jar -out foo com.example.foo.Foo
```

The generated files are used as follows:

*   Running `ant devmode` from the command-line brings up the new application in superDevMode.
*   Running `ant build` from the command-line translates the Java app to JavaScript, creating a web folder called `foo` in the `war` directory.
*   `Foo.launch` is a launch configuration for Eclipse.
*   `FooTest-dev.launch` is a launch configuration for Eclipse that will run the project's tests in development mode.
*   `FooTest-prod.launch` is a launch configuration for Eclipse that will run the project's tests in production mode.
*   The other files implement a small sample GWT application.

You will notice that the `build.xml` file contains a number of rules to compile and deploy your application. These will help to resolve the libraries needed at compile-time and runtime to compile and deploy your application, respectively.

Notice also that there are some properties that you might like to extract to a `build.properties` file, such as the `gwt.sdk` property, to make it easier to share the same build script with teammates who may have different configurations on their development machines. Also, this `build.xml` file serves as an excellent base to grow on as your project takes on more dependencies or requires more specific build targets (for example, unit testing targets).



## i18nCreator<a id="i18nCreator"></a>

A command-line tool that generates scripts to help with [static string internationalization](DevGuideI18n.html#DevGuideStaticStringInternationalization), along with sample [properties files](DevGuideI18n.html#DevGuidePropertiesFiles). Modify the `.properties` files to suit your project. Run the generated
`<classname>-i18n` script to (re)generate a Java interface for accessing the tags defined in your properties files.

```text
i18nCreator [-eclipse projectName] [-out dir] [-[no]overwriteFiles] \
            [-[no]createConstantsWithLookup] [-[no]createMessages] \
            [-[no]ignoreExistingFiles] interfaceName
```

| Parameter                        | Definition |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| -eclipse                        | Creates a i18n update launch config for the named eclipse project.
| -out                            | The directory to write output files into (defaults to current)
| -[no]overwriteFiles             | Overwrite any existing files. (defaults to OFF)
| -[no]createConstantsWithLookup  | Create scripts for a ConstantsWithLookup interface rather than a | Constants one. (defaults to OFF)
| -[no]createMessages             | Create scripts for a Messages interface rather than a Constants one. (defaults to OFF)
| -[no]ignoreExistingFiles        | Ignore any existing files; do not overwrite. (defaults to OFF)
| interfaceName                   | The fully qualified name of the interface to create

### Example

```text
~/Foo> i18nCreator -eclipse Foo -createMessages com.example.foo.client.FooMessages
 Created file src/com/example/foo/client/FooMessages.properties
 Created file FooMessages-i18n.launch
 Created file FooMessages-i18n
```

Running `FooMessages-i18n` will generate an interface class in a file named `FooMessages.java` from `FooMessages.properties` that extends `Messages`
(The messages will take parameters, substituting `{n}` with the nth parameter).

```text
~/Foo> i18nCreator -eclipse Foo com.example.foo.client.FooConstants
 Created file src/com/example/foo/client/FooConstants.properties
 Created file FooConstants-i18n.launch
 Created file FooConstants-i18n
```

Running `FooConstants-i18n` will generate an interface from `FooConstants.properties` that extends `Constants` (The constants will not take parameters). To
create a `ConstantsWithLookup` class, pass the `-createConstantsWithLookup` option.

In both examples, The launch configurations do the same thing as the scripts, but are intended to be run from within the Eclipse IDE.

_**Tip**: When new entries are added to the properties file, the `-i18n` scripts must be run again._

Welcome to the GWT developer community. A number of community resources are already available for GWT that you can begin using today. We're excited to share these with you, and we invite you to get involved in these channels and contribute your own knowledge and experience back to the community.

## Discussion groups/lists

We've established a set of discussion groups/mailing lists to help you find answers to your technical issues as well as enabling you to share your latest tips and tricks and projects with the greater GWT developer community. Each group has a particular purpose, summarized below.

*   **General discussion** - If you are new to GWT and have general questions about the product that aren't addressed in the overview documentation, this group is for you.
    *   [Group Charter](community-group-charter.html) (audience, rules, moderators)
    *   Go to the group: [google-web-toolkit](http://groups.google.com/group/google-web-toolkit)
    *   Subscribe via email: [google-web-toolkit-subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:google-web-toolkit-subscribe@googlegroups.com)  
*   **GWT Contributors** - If interested in contributing to the [GWT open source project](makinggwtbetter.html) this is your group. For more general questions not concerned with source code contribution, please use the general discussion forum.
    *   Go to the group: [google-web-toolkit-contributors](http://groups.google.com/group/google-web-toolkit-contributors)
    *   Subscribe via email: [google-web-toolkit-contributors-subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:google-web-toolkit-contributors-subscribe@googlegroups.com)
*   **GWT Steering** - This is the place where the GWT Steering Committee talks in the open about the future of the project (roadmap, communication, etc.) and bureaucratic stuff. Your feedback is (more than) welcome, so do not hesitate to send it to the GWT Contributors group. 
    *   Go to the group: [gwt-steering](http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-steering)
    *   Subscribe via email: [gwt-steering-subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:gwt-steering-subscribe@googlegroups.com)
*   **Speed Tracer** - If you are interested in hearing about new features, or in contributing to Speed Tracer.
    *   Go to the group: [speedtracer](https://groups.google.com/group/speedtracer)
    *   Visit the [codesite project](http://code.google.com/p/speedtracer).
*   **CodePro AnalytiX, GWT Designer, WindowBuilder Pro, and WindowTester Pro discussions** - If you're looking for Q&amp;A as well as general conversation regarding any of these tools, this is the site for you.
    *   Product forums: [http://forums.instantiations.com](http://forums.instantiations.com)

1.  Read the [official FAQs](doc/latest/FAQ.html). The most commonly-asked GWT questions are already addressed in these lists.
2.  Enter one or more keywords of your question in the search box at the top of this page. Relevant results from the documentation pages on Google Code as well as GWT articles and blog entries will be returned.
3.  Search the mailing list archives to see whether your questions have already been discussed.
4.  Read the [GWT discussion group charter](http://groups.google.com/group/google-web-toolkit/web/gwt-discussion-group-charter) which highlights the community guidelines.

## Other communities

There is a [GWT Gitter Community](https://gitter.im/gwtproject/gwt). There's also the unofficial IRC channel ##gwt on the [Freenode network](https://freenode.net/).

## Contribute

There are several ways to contribute back to the GWT community.

*   Getting involved with discussions in the general [GWT group](http://groups.google.com/group/google-web-toolkit) is a great way of educating others that are in need of assistance or are just getting started with GWT.
*   Contributing source code patches and updates to the project itself is a way to share new features and functionality that you benefited from with the rest of the community. If code contribution is something you are interested in, be sure to check out [Making GWT Better](makinggwtbetter.html) and discussions that are taking place over at the [GWT Contributors group](http://groups.google.com/group/google-web-toolkit-contributors).

## Other developers and projects

To see how other developers used GWT to build real-world applications, be sure to checkout our [Developer Spotlight](developer_spotlight.html) section. Here developers from several third-party companies talk about specific features that they used to build their applications, what they like and would like to see from GWT, as well as tips and learnings from developing with GWT.

You can also find a wide variety of open source [projects related to GWT](https://github.com/search?q=GWT) hosted on Github.

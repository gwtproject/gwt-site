<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <div>
    Google is a member of the GWT Open Source Project and operates this GWT website as a contribution to GWT. The <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a> applies to Google's operation of this website.
  
  </div>


<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>
describes how we treat personal information when you use Google services,
including information provided when you use GWT. In addition,
the following describes privacy practices specific to GWT.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>When you use GWT's development mode server or compiler, 
   the application periodically sends a unique timestamp ID and version 
   number of your product back to Google's servers so that the application 
   can notify you of new versions. The timestamp ID is generated the first 
   time you use the complier or development mode server. As a part of this 
   request, Google will log the timestamp ID and the version number.</p>

<p>The GWT developer plugin checks for updates once a day or as configured on the respective browser, sending the current plugin version number. As a part of this request, Google will log the plugin version number. </p>

<p>We won't log cookies or personal information about you, and we will only use any data we log in the aggregate to operate and improve GWT.</p>



<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>We use this information internally to determine usage volume of the development mode server and 
  compiler in the aggregate. </p>


<h2>Your Choices</h2>

<p>You may choose to not use the development mode server and uninstall the
  the browser plugin at any time. You may use just the  GWT compiler with the 
  flag "-XdisableUpdateCheck" to compile 
  your code directly to JavaScript. This does not send a request for the most 
  recent version of GWT.</p> 


<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">Department of Commerce's website</a>.</p>

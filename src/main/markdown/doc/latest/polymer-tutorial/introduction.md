# Building a modern GWT app using Polymer Elements:

## **Disclaimer** <a id="pol-disclaimer"></a>:
_This tutorial is based on the usage of three 3rd party **open-source** libraries out of the **gwtproject** organization_:

* _[**Polymer**][1]: a javascript library for building web applications out of web components and owned by **Google Inc**._
* _[**Polymer Elements**][5]: a collection of widgets built in Polymer owned by **Google Inc**._
* _[**GWT-Polymer-Elements**][3]: a Java wrapper which allows to use Polymer Elements in GWT projects, it's owned by **Vaadin Ltd**._

The main goal of the tutorial is to teach our audience the full process of creating real GWT projects interacting with real JS stuff. But **gwtproject** does not want to recomend the usage of any of those components.

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to write a **TodoList** application using [Polymer][0] Web Components. [Web Components][1] define a collection of standards allowing us to bundle markup and styles into custom HTML elements. Polymer is a JS library to make easier deal with Web Components.

In this case, we want to fulfil the [Material Design][2] specification. Therefore, we’ll be using the Vaadin [gwt-polymer-elements][3] library. This library, generated by [gwt-api-generator][4], is a JsInterop wrapper for the Polymer [Iron and Paper][5] elements.

Before we start, you might want to try out the [TodoList][6] application to see what we are about to build.

## The Learning process

During this build process you’ll learn how to:

* Create a new Maven project.
* Run your project using `SuperDevMode`.
* Add external libraries to your application.
* Configure the project to use the experimental `JsInterop` mode.

This application can be built using either widgets or JsInterop elements. The former is the classic approach, while the latter has become the new tendency. Either option will teach you how to:

* Create new widgets using UiBinder.
* Import and use Polymer Web Components.
* Deal with responsive layouts.
* Style elements using `UiBinder`.
* Add event handlers to UiBinder components.
* Use a basic data model.

Compiling and Debugging
===

Let's start with the core principle of GWT development:

1.  If your GWT application runs in development mode as you expect...
2.  and the GWT compiler successfully compiles your application into JavaScript...
3.  then your application will work the same way in a web browser as it did in development mode.

The rest of this section introduces development mode (previously called "hosted mode")
and production mode (previously called "web mode") and explains how and when to use each.

## Debugging in Development Mode<a id="DevGuideDevMode"></a>

You will spend most of your development time running your application in
_development mode_, which means that you are interacting with your GWT
application without it having been translated into JavaScript. Anytime you
edit, run, and debug applications from a Java integrated development
environment (IDE), you are working in development mode. When an application is
running in development mode, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is actually
executing the application code as compiled Java bytecode, using GWT plumbing
to connect to a browser window. This means that the debugging facilities of
your IDE are available to debug both your client-side GWT code and any
server-side Java code as well. By remaining in this traditional
"code-test-debug" cycle, development mode is by far the most
productive way to develop your application quickly.

A typical development mode session can be seen below:

![DevModeTypical](images/DevModeTypical.jpg)

### Launching an application in development mode<a id="launching_in_dev_mode"></a>

To launch a development mode session, from the command line run `ant
devmode`, assuming you have an Ant `build.xml` file generated by
webAppCreator.

**Tip:** If you are using Eclipse, you can instead run the `<app>.launch` configuration file created by webAppCreator using the Run or Debug
menus.

If you didn't use webAppCreator, you can manually run the main class in
`com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode` found in `gwt-dev.jar`.

**Important:** If you are not using a generated launch config,
be aware that GWT development mode looks for [modules](DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideModules) (and therefore [client-side](DevGuideCodingBasics.html#DevGuideClientSide) source) using the JVM's classpath.
Make sure to add your source directories first in your classpath.

### GWT Development Mode<a id="dev_mode"></a>

_Note: this section describes using development mode without the Google
Plugin for Eclipse_.

The GWT Development Mode window opens up initially with two tabs.  The first
provides an interface to launching your GWT module(s) and logs that aren't
specific to a particular module.

[![DevelopmentShell1](images/DevelopmentShell1.png)](images/DevelopmentShell1.png)
<div style="margin-left: 18em; font-size: 80%;">_(Click to enlarge)_</div>

#### Serving the application

The second tab displays log messages from the embedded web server.  By
default, development mode runs an internal Jetty instance to serve your web
application. This embedded Jetty instance serves directly out of your
project's war directory.

You can disable this internal server by passing the `-noserver`
option to development mode and instead run your own external server. See FAQ ["How do I use my own server in
development mode instead of GWT's built-in server?"](#use_my_own_server_in_development_mode_instead_of_GWT)

### Launching a Browser<a id="launching_a_browser"></a>

As of GWT 2.0, development mode uses a regular browser instead of an
embedded browser.  You can use any supported browser, including ones on other
machines, as long as it has the GWT Developer Plugin installed.  If you use
a browser that does not have the plugin installed, you will get a message
with an offer to download the plugin.

Browsers are typically opened automatically via the `-startupUrl`
command line option (though GWT will try to find plausible startup URLs if you
do not supply any).  To launch an application, choose the URL you want to use,
and choose **Launch Default Browser**.  GWT uses a number of heuristics
to determine which browser to use, but depending on your setup it may not
launch the one you want.  In that case, you can choose **Copy to Clipboard**
and the URL you need to launch will be copied to the system clipboard (and will
also be shown in the log window).  You can then paste this URL into any
browser with the plugin installed, or you can type in the URL to a browser on
a different machine (in which case you will have to change the host names in
the URL as necessary).

[![HostedMode1](images/HostedMode1.png)](images/HostedMode1.png)

When a module is loaded in a browser, you will see a new tab which contains
the logs for one URL in a particular browser.  If there are multiple
modules on one page, there will be a drop-down box to select which module's
logs are shown.  When you refresh a page, there is a session drop-down box
which lets you select which session's logs to show.

#### Refreshing development mode

You do not need to restart development mode after modifying your source
code. Instead, with Development Mode still running, edit client code or
resources, save your changes, then refresh the page in your browser.
On refresh, your code is recompiled with the changes and the new version is
loaded into the browser. Refreshing the browser is much faster than closing
and restarting Development Mode.

You might notice that sometimes your changes take effect even if you
_do not_ refresh the browser. This behavior is a result of the way
development mode interacts with the compiled code, but it is not always
reliable. Specifically, it only happens when you make minor changes to
existing functions and the IDE is able to replace the running code. To ensure
your changes are included, make it a habit to always refresh the browser after
making changes.

#### Reloading server code

Similarly, the _Restart Server_ button in the Jetty tab allows you to
restart the embedded Jetty server without having to close and restart
Development Mode. This is useful when you have made configuration or code
changes to your server-side code. All server-side classes will be reloaded
from scratch with fresh code for your `war/WEB-INF/classes` and
`war/WEB-INF/lib` folders. If you are getting an [IncompatibleRemoteServiceException](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/user/client/rpc/IncompatibleRemoteServiceException.html)
in development mode while using RPC, try restarting the server and refreshing
the client.

### Generating debug messages in development mode: GWT.log()<a id="generating_debug_messages"></a>

Debugging messages are displayed within the Development Mode log window.
Some of these messages are from GWT. However, you can generate your own debug
messages by using calls to [GWT.log()](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/core/client/GWT.html#log-java.lang.String-java.lang.Throwable-).

For example, modifying the standard project to emit a debug message inside
the [ClickHandler](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/event/dom/client/ClickHandler.html)
results in a debug message displaying on the log window whenever the user
clicks the button.

```java
import com.google.gwt.core.client.GWT;

   ...

   button.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() {
      public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
        GWT.log("User Pressed a button.", null); // Added debugging message
        if (label.getText().equals(""))
          label.setText("Hello World!");
        else
          label.setText("");
      }
    });
```

[![DevelopmentShell2](images/DevelopmentShell2.png)](images/DevelopmentShell2.png)

Calls to GWT.log() are intended just for use while debugging your
application. They are optimized out in production mode. For example, consider
the following change to the onClick() method intended to intentionally trigger
an exception:

```java
public void onClick(Widget sender) {
        GWT.log("User pressed a button.", null);
        Object nullObject = null;
        nullObject.toString(); // Should cause NullPointerException
```

When the application encounters an exception, a message is printed on the
module's log window. The exception is highlighted with a red icon. In this
example, when you click on the button in the browser window, a
NullPointerException is triggered and the back trace for the exception
displays in the status area below the log area. Clicking on the exception
message or icon displays the full text of the exception in the message area
below.

[![DevelopmentShell3](images/DevelopmentShell3.png)](images/DevelopmentShell3.png)

### Enabling internal GWT debug messages<a id="enabling_internal_debug"></a>

The log window can display more verbose debugging if you invoke it by
specifying the `-logLevel` command-line argument. Specifying the level
of `SPAM` turns on many messages inside of the GWT engine. These
messages are displayed in a hierarchical tree which can be manipulated by
clicking on individual lines or by using the Expand All and Collapse All icons
in the toolbar.

[![DevelopmentShell4](images/DevelopmentShell4.png)](images/DevelopmentShell4.png)

### Using an IDE with Development Mode<a id="using_an_ide_with_dev_mode"></a>

When using an IDE such as Eclipse, JBuilder, or IntelliJ, it is easy to use
the IDE's built-in Java debugger to debug your module. Simply set a breakpoint
somewhere inside your code, (such as the `onModuleLoad()` entry point)
where you want the debugger to stop and let you inspect the state of your
program. For an example of debugging in development mode using the Eclipse
IDE, see the Getting Started tutorial, [Debugging a GWT
Application](tutorial/debug.html).

### An Example Launch<a id="an_example_launch"></a>

Let's look behind the scenes when you launch your GWT application in
development mode. To run development mode, you start a Java VM using the main
class `com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode`. If you look inside a generated
ant `build.xml`, you'll find something like this:

```xml
<target name="devmode" depends="javac" description="Run development mode">
  <java failonerror="true" fork="true" classname="com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode">
    <classpath>
      <pathelement location="src"/>
      <path refid="project.class.path"/>
    </classpath>
    <jvmarg value="-Xmx256M"/>
    <arg value="-startupUrl"/>
    <arg value="Hello.html"/>
    <!-- Additional arguments like -style PRETTY or -logLevel DEBUG -->
    <arg value="com.google.gwt.sample.hello.Hello"/>
  </java>
</target>
```

This is similar to running the following command on the command line:

```shell
java -Xmx256M -cp "src;war/WEB-INF/classes;\gwt-2.0.0\gwt-user.jar;\gwt-2.0.0\gwt-dev.jar"
  com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode -startupUrl Hello.html com.google.gwt.sample.hello.Hello
```

The `-startupUrl` parameter tells Development Mode which URL(s) to
make available for launching. If the value excludes the domain, the domain is
assumed to be `localhost`. The port is assumed to be the port running
the embedded server. In the example above, this address is
`http://localhost:8888/Hello.html` (with an additional parameter giving
the location of the development mode code server).

The final parameter (the one at the end with no flag preceding it) is the
module or set of modules we care about. This value is required in order to
correctly initialize the war directory with bootstrap scripts for any GWT
modules you may wish to run.

### Language differences between production mode and development mode<a id="What_are_the_language_differences_between_production_mode_and_development_mo"></a>

Typically, if your code runs as intended in development mode and compiles to JavaScript without error, production mode behavior will be equivalent. Occasional different problems can cause
subtle bugs to appear in production mode that don't appear in development mode. Fortunately those cases are rare.

A [full list of known language-related "gotchas"](DevGuideCodingBasicsCompatibility.html) is available in the GWT documentation.

### Using EJBs in development mode<a id="using_EJBs_in_development_mode"></a>

GWT provides the `-noserver` option to the development mode shell script for this sort of thing.

The `-noserver` option instructs development mode to not start the embedded Jetty instance. In its place, you would run the J2EE container of your choice and simply use that
in place of the embedded Jetty instance.

### Using my own server in development mode instead of GWT's built-in Jetty instance<a id="use_my_own_server_in_development_mode_instead_of_GWT"></a>

If you do not need to use, or prefer not to use, the Jetty instance embedded in GWT's development mode to serve up your servlets for debugging, you can use the `-noserver`
flag to prevent Jetty from starting, while still taking advantage of development mode for debugging your GWT client code.

If you need the `-noserver` option, it is likely because your server-side code that handles your XMLHTTPRequest data requests requires something more, or just something
different than Jetty. Here are some example cases where you might need to use `-noserver`:

*   You need an EJB container, which the embedded Jetty server does not support.
*   You have an extensive Servlet configuration (with custom web.xml and possibly server.xml files) that is too inconvenient to use with the embedded Jetty.
*   You are not using J2EE on the server at all (for example, you might be using JSON with Python).

When using the `-noserver` flag, your external server is used by the GWT Development Mode browser to serve up both your dynamic content, and all static content (such as the
GWT application's host page, other HTML files, images, CSS, and so on.) This allows you to structure your project files in whatever way is most convenient to your application and
infrastructure.

Though your own external server handles all static content and dynamic resources, all browser application logic continues to be handled in Java, internal to development mode. This
means that you can continue to debug your client-side code in Java as usual, but all server-side requests will be served by your web or application server of choice. (If you are
using an IDE such as Eclipse configured to integrate with GWT's development mode for debugging, then using -noserver will prevent you from automatically debugging your server code in
the same debugger instance you use to debug development mode. However, if the server software you use supports it, you can of course use an external debugging tools.)

Here is a step-by-step description of how to use `-noserver`:

1.  Configure your server however you need to; note the URL which contains the host page for your GWT application.
2.  Arrange all your static content files (such as the host HTML page, images, CSS, etc.) on the server however you like.
3.  Edit your development mode execution script (such as your Eclipse run configuration or the ant development build target generated by the GWT webAppCreator) and add or update the following options:
    *   Add the `-noserver` command line argument.
    *   Change the URL at the end of the argument list to match the URL you recorded in step #1.
4.  Compile your application once using the ant build target.  Ideally, you can use GWT's -war option to generate output files directly into your
external server's static content folder.  Otherwise, you'll need to copy the GWT output folder from `war/<moduleName>` to your external server's
static content.

Be careful not to omit copying the files in Step #4: This is an action you'll only have to do once, but is a necessary step. However, one important point to note is that
you may need to replace the `.gwt.rpc` file if your application uses GWT RPC and if the types that your application serializes across the wire implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface. If these types are changed, or new serializable types are added to your RPC calls, the GWT compiler will generate a new .gwt.rpc file. You will need to replace the old file deployed on your web server with the newly generated file. However, if your web server targets the GWT compiler's war output directory as the war directory for your application, you will not need to re-compile for these changes, and development mode will take care of generating and correctly placing the `*.gwt.rpc` file.

### Development Mode Options<a id="What_options_can_be_passed_to_development_mode"></a>

There are many options you can pass to the development mode process to control how you want to start up the development mode browser. These options can differ slightly from version to version, but will generally include the options shown in the command-line help text below:

```text

```

Any time you want to look up the development mode options available for your version of GWT, you can simply invoke the DevMode class from command-line as shown above and it will list out the options available along with their descriptions.  (Run the command from the directory containing `gwt-dev.jar` or add the path ahead of that file: `-cp _path_/gwt-dev.jar`.)

### Super Dev Mode<a id="SuperDevMode"></a>

Early adopters may wish to try out an alternative to Development Mode. See
[Introducing Super Dev Mode](../../articles/superdevmode.html)

## Running in Production Mode<a id="DevGuideProdMode"></a>

After you have your application working well in _development_ mode,
you will want to try out your application in your target web browsers; that
is, you want to run it in _production_ mode.

Running your application in production mode allows you to test your
application as it is deployed. If you have a servlet component specified in
your `web.xml` file, your GWT RPC calls will also be served to the
browser. You can also take a different browser or a browser running on another
machine and point it at the same URL (substitute the hostname or IP address of
your workstation for `localhost` in the URL.)

Running in production mode is a good way to test:

<dl>
<dt>The performance of your application</dt>
<dd>
Development mode uses a special engine to run your app as a mix of both Java
bytecode and native JavaScript. If your code makes many calls back and forth
between Java and JavaScript, your code may seem slower in development mode
than it will actually be in production mode. This can be particularly true of
UI code. On the other hand, intense algorithmic pure Java code will tend to
run faster in development mode, since the JVM outperforms most JavaScript
engines.

If your application displays lots of data or has a large number of widgets,
you will want to confirm that performance will be acceptable when the
application is finally deployed.
</dd>

<dt>How your application looks on different browsers</dt>
<dd>Because GWT widgets use a browser's native DOM components, the look and
feel of your application might change from browser to browser. More
importantly, if you are using a style sheet, you will want to inspect your
application carefully on each browser.</dd>

<dt>How your application logic performs on different browsers</dt>
<dd>GWT is designed to provide cross-browser support so that the average GWT
developer does not need to worry about cross-browser support. But if you are
a widget author or if you are using a third party JavaScript library, you will
need to confirm that these components are working correctly on each target
browser you plan to support.</dd>

</dl>

## Understanding the GWT Compiler<a id="DevGuideJavaToJavaScriptCompiler"></a>

The heart of GWT is a compiler that converts Java source into JavaScript, transforming your working Java application into an equivalent JavaScript application.

The GWT compiler supports the vast majority of the Java language. The [GWT runtime library](DevGuideCodingBasics.html#DevGuideJavaCompatibility) emulates a relevant
subset of the Java runtime library. If a JRE class or method is not supported, the compiler will emit an error.

You can run the compiler with the name of the module you want to compile in one of the following manners:

*   Run the main class `com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler` using `java` from the command-line.
*   If you used the webAppCreator script to create your project, you can use Ant to run the generated `build.xml`.
*   If you are using the Google Plugin for Eclipse, you can compile your application by clicking GWT Compile Project button ![icon](tutorial/images/GWTCompileProject.png).

Once compilation completes successfully, directories will be created containing the JavaScript implementation of your project. The compiler will create one directory for each
module it compiles.

```text
C:\gwt-2.6.1\samples\Hello>ant
Buildfile: build.xml

libs:

javac:

gwtc:
     [java] Compiling module com.google.gwt.sample.hello.Hello
     [java]    Compiling 5 permutations
     [java]       Permutation compile succeeded
     [java]    Linking into war
     [java]       Link succeeded
     [java]    Compilation succeeded -- 20.313s

build:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 22 seconds
```

After running the GWT compiler your war directory should look something like this:

```text
C:\gwt-2.6.1\samples\Hello>\bin\find war
war
war\hello
war\hello\18EEC2DA45CB5F0C2050E2539AE61FCE.cache.html

In the above example, `war/hello/hello.nocache.js` is the script you would include in a host HTML page to load the Hello application. In this case, the host HTML page is
located at `war/Hello.html` and loads the GWT startup script through the relative URL `hello/hello.nocache.js`.

You may have noticed in the compilation target in the build.xml file generated by the webAppCreator uses the war output directory as both an input and output source. This doesn't have to be the case, and you can easily configure the war directory as the output directory only, while using other directories as source directory paths by adding build targets to copy static resources from the source to the final output directory. See this [war directory FAQ](FAQ_DebuggingAndCompiling.html#Is_the_war_directory_used_by_GWT_compiler_for_both_input_and_output) for more details.

The other thing you may have noticed is that there are a number of other files generated along with the GWT compiler output. Of these there are a few that are key to [deploying your application](DevGuideDeploying.html).

### Key application files<a id="key_application_files"></a>

After running the GWT compiler, you'll find the output in the WAR, or Web Archive, folder with the following structure:

![img](../../images/war_output_dir.png)

If you've worked with GWT prior to the 1.6 release, the files in the `war/hello` directory are familiar to you. The only difference is where these files are now generated, and the fact that the [host HTML page](DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideHostPage) and CSS files are not in the same directory as the rest of the `.cache.html/png` files. The path where these files are generated is controlled by the GWT module XML file. These are the key applications files to deploy you GWT application on your web server.

<dt>The host HTML page</dt>

The [host HTML page](DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideHostPage) is the first page your clients should visit when they browse to your application and is also where the rest of your application files are loaded from. To load your application, the host HTML page must contain a `<script>` tag referencing your GWT application bootstrap file (described below). You would typically include a `<link>` tag referencing your application CSS file as well, unless you inject the stylesheet directly by adding the `<stylesheet>` tag to your module XML file.

You could also load the script from anywhere else in a website, but the default start page is typically the entry point that developers use to load their GWT applications. The host page from the Hello starter sample application mentioned above is shown below.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="Hello.css">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

<script type="text/javascript" language='javascript' src='hello/hello.nocache.js'></script>
    <!-- Along with page title and table headers defined -->
  </body>
</html>
```

<dt>The Bootstrap File</dt>

You may have noticed that one of the generated files is named after your module, followed by a `.nocache.js` suffix. This is the GWT bootstrap file. Similar to the output subdirectory `war/<app_name>`, the name of this file is also controlled by the `rename-to` attribute in your module XML file. This file is responsible for choosing the correct version of your application to load for your client based on their browser and locale, or any other custom selection rule (see [Deferred Binding](DevGuideCodingBasics.html#DevGuideDeferredBinding)). The various versions of your application compliant to each browser / locale are the `<md5>.cache.html` application files (discussed below).

The host HTML page references this file so that clients visiting your page first download the bootstrap, and the bootstrap script in turn figures out which browser environment it is running in and determines the appropriate version of your application to load. See the [documentation](DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideBootstrap) on the bootstrap process for more details.

<dt>Application Files</dt>

The `<md5>.cache.html` files generated in the `war/<app_name>` directory, along with the bootstrap script, are the most important part of the generated fileset. They represent one version of your application tailored to a specific browser (or locale). These are the application files that the bootstrap script selects after it determines which browser it's running on.

Another generated application file that isn't strictly necessary to deploy your GWT application, but required if you're using GWT RPC and the support for the Serializable interface for types transferred through RPC, is the `<md5>.gwt.rpc` file. The serialization policy file must be accessible by your RPC [RemoteServiceServlet](/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/user/server/rpc/RemoteServiceServlet.html) via the [ServletContext.getResource()](http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#getResource\(java.lang.String\)) call.

### Public Resources<a id="public_resources"></a>

All public resources, such as image files, stylesheets or XML files, can be placed anywhere under the war directory or any subdirectory therein during development. As long as references to these resources in your GWT application code hold when deployed, you can expect your application to work properly in production. In GWT 1.6 and later, the `<public>` tag is still respected, so you can place public resources in a public directory, as defined in your module XML file, and these resources will be copied into the `war/<app_name>` folder. However, the best practice would be to place public resources in the war directory and work with them from that location. This complies with the standard [Servlet 2.5 API specification](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr154/index2.html), and makes it easier to deploy your application if you're planning to deploy on a servlet container.

If you're using [ClientBundle](DevGuideClientBundle.html) in
your application, the generated bundles are placed in the
`war/<app_name>` directory after compilation.

### Perfect Caching<a id="perfect_caching"></a>

Among other optimization and performance improvement techniques, GWT also offers the concept of "Perfect Caching", which you can take advantage of if you deploy your application correctly.

You may have noticed that the bootstrap script filename contains a `.nocache.js` suffix, whereas the rest of the GWT application files contain a `.cache.html` suffix. These are meant as indicators that you can use to configure your web server to implement perfect caching. The bootstrap script is named after a well-known application name (`<app_name>.nocache.js`), while the GWT application files all contain md5 sums in their names. Those md5 sums are computed from your GWT codebase at the time of compilation. The bootstrap script contains a lookup table that selects the right `<md5>.cache.html` file when your client first visits your site and loads up your GWT application. The bootstrap process is explained in greater detail [here](DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideBootstrap).

The fact that the application filenames will always change if your codebase changes means that your clients can safely cache these resources and don't need to refetch the GWT application files each time they visit your site. The resource that should never be completely cached (an If-Modified-Since fetch is sufficient and saves bandwidth) is the bootstrap script, since it contains the logic necessary to lookup the correct application file. If you were to configure these rules on an Apache HTTP server, you might get something like this in your `.htaccess` config file, using both mod_expires and mod_headers:

```xml
<Files *.nocache.*>
  ExpiresActive on
  ExpiresDefault "now"
  Header merge Cache-Control "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
</Files>

<Files *.cache.*>
  ExpiresActive on
  ExpiresDefault "now plus 1 year"
</Files>
```

### GWT Compiler Options<a id="DevGuideCompilerOptions"></a>

There are many options you can pass to the GWT compiler process to control how you want to compile your GWT application and where you want the output to be generated. These options can differ slightly from version to version, but will generally include the options shown in the command-line help text below:

```text

Any time you want to look up GWT compiler options available for your version of GWT, you can simply invoke the Compiler class from command-line as shown above and it will list out the options available along with their descriptions.  (Run the command from the directory containing `gwt-dev.jar` or add the path ahead of that file: `-cp _path_/gwt-dev.jar`.)

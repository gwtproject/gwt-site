<h2>Welcome to the GWT Discussion Group!</h2>

<p>
The GWT (GWT) allows developers to use the Java
programming language to build no-compromise AJAX applications.&nbsp;
This is the official discussion forum for GWT.
</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
GWT consists of a Java-to-JavaScript compiler, user interface API, and
related tools.&nbsp; It allows developers to write and debug browser
AJAX applications in the Java language using Java tools, and then
compile and deploy those applications into pure JavaScript.&nbsp; If
you use GWT or are interested in it, this group is for you!
</p>

<p>
GWT is open source, and is licensed according to the terms of the <a title="Apache 2.0 License" href="terms.html">Apache 2.0 License</a>.

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>
This Discussion Group is intended for developers using GWT to build
applications.&nbsp; Everyone is welcome to join in, provided you follow
our community's policies described below.&nbsp; Our users help each
other, and there are many experts who post to this group, including
some from Google.
</p>

<p>
No topic is off-limits, provided it relates to GWT in some way.&nbsp; However, since it <i>is</i> a
very busy list, please check out the list of resources above before
posting your question;&nbsp; you may find your question has already
been answered.
</p>


<h2>Discussion Group Rules</h2>

<p>
We love simplicity and hate restrictions, so we also keep our policies
simple and minimal.&nbsp; The rules below describe what's expected of
subscribers to this forum.
</p>


<ul>
  <li><b>Please be Friendly</b>

Showing courtesy and respect to others is a vital part of the
Google culture, and we expect everyone participating in the
GWT community to join us in accepting nothing less. Being
courteous does not mean we can't constructively disagree with
each other, but it does mean that we must be polite when we do so.
There's <b>never</b> a reason to be antagonistic or
dismissive toward anyone;&nbsp; if you think there is, you should think again before you post.
</p>

<p>
Sure, web development is serious business and all that, but it's
also a lot of fun. Let's keep it that way. Let's strive to be one of the
friendliest communities in all of open source.
</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Allowed Discussion Topics</b>

Most topics are technical discussions of GWT or users helping each other,
but this Group is intended for discussion of everything under the Sun
in the world of GWT.&nbsp; That means we also welcome announcements and
discussion of products, libraries, publications, and other interesting
GWT-related news.&nbsp; We even welcome (polite!) discussion of
articles and ideas critical of GWT -- after all, we can't improve if we
don't listen.&nbsp; There are no restrictions on the subject matter,
and we don't exclude commercial products from our discussion, if users
are interested in talking about them.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
However, we hate spam almost as passionately as we love courtesy and respect, so we
reserve the right to limit discussions that amount to spam.&nbsp;
Outright spam, of course, will result in that user being immediately
and permanently banned from the list.
</p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Language Policy</b>

<p>
The primary language for this group is English, however if you have trouble communicating your ideas or the issues you're facing in English, feel free to post in your native language. The members of this community come from all corners of the globe, so it's very likely that a fellow member speaks your language and will be able to get back to you with some helpful information. That said, please do try to post in English first to get help. You can also include a translate version of the post content in your own native language if you feel that you weren't able to communicate your problem in English. If that fails, feel free to post in your native language.</b></b>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see our rules are simple, and the most important rule is friendliness.&nbsp;
Remember:&nbsp; disrespect and rudeness &mdash; under <b>any</b> circumstances
-- is not welcome in our community.&nbsp; We don't have a formal policy
on dealing with troublemakers, and we hope we never need to come up
with one.&nbsp; That said, though, we do pledge to do our best to be
fair, and we will always try to warn someone before banning him or her.
</p>


<h2>Contacting the Moderators</h2>

<p>
If you see anyone being rude, by all means call them out on it; this is
your group too, and you don't have to accept someone else being
disrespectful just because it wasn't directed at you.&nbsp; Just remember to
be <b>polite</b> and <b>courteous</b> yourself!&nbsp; Don't add fuel to the fire.
</p>

<p>
But, if you see an outrageous violation, want to report spam, feel very
strongly about something, or even if you just want to chat, then by all
means <a title="contact the Group's owners" href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/post?sendowner=1&amp;_done=%2Fgroup%2FGoogle-Web-Toolkit%2Fabout%3F&amp;">contact the Group's owners</a>.&nbsp; It's what we're here for!

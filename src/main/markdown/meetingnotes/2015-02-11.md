* GWT 2.8 release
    * Manuel and Julien will do the release. Julien will be the point person.
    * Colin also volunteered to help
    * Features:
        * GSS as default, new migration guide
            * Compiler will error if CSS is used, need to use special flag for CSS
            * Next release beyond 2.8 will not support CSS
        * Java8 - full support for emulation is a question.
        * Interop v1 - Google GWT engineers are working on deciding what should be included in v1.
        * Unlikely to happen before April
* Eclipse plug-ins for GWT
    * GPE is still not buildable externally
    * Plan is to super-cede GPE with GWT plug-in
    * Both plug-ins should work side-by-side
    * Why is GWT GPE plug-in different from other plug-ins? Should it be externally hosted similar to maven and gradle?
    * Decision on this deferred.

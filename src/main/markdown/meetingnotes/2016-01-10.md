* No quorum, we only have 4 people show up. May want to plan a follow-up meeting. Bhaskar will ask SC members if they want one.
* GWT 2.8
    * Beta version is working for RH.
    * Working on fixing Interop bugs, should be getting close to the end
    * Memory problem with JDT, now down to 1.5x memory usage compared to earlier.
    * Plan to do RC1 once interop problems are fixed.

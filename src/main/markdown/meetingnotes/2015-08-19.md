* Dev mode discussion
    * Daniel is migrating test cases to compile-mode, no more need to support dev-mode within Google.
    * Since 2.8 is a compatible release, removing dev-mode will go against what we said earlier.
    * People using 2.7 are still using dev mode, super dev mode is just barely working. 
    * Daniel: make compile-test default in 2.8, 
        * Also let people know what limitations come with JsInterop and dev-mode. 
    * Drop it in trunk after 2.8.
* GWT 2.8:
    * Main missing feature is JsInterop
        * Expectation is that this will be complete by end of Sept.
    * Plan to release after JsInterop is done. Will accept Java8 patches from community, but those are not blockers for right now. 
* Update on new compiler prototype:
    * Still working through compilation of Java features.
    * Plan is to have it capable of building complete apps by the end of the year.

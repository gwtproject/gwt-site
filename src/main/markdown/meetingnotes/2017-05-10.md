    * nominated Max Barkley from RedHat to join the committee, agreed on by all present, Colin will reach out for the next meeting.
* Julien: Elemental2 and generator
    * in the process of being open sourced
    * will be on the google github org
    * jsinterop base/annotations will be managed together, removed from gwt codebase
    * tentatively expected to be done by end of Q2
* GWT 2.9 planning - topics will be followed up in gwt-contrib
* Discussion around removing dev mode as part of 2.9
    * For:
        * while present, JsInterop cannot be used within gwt-user beyond jre emul
        * in addition to never supporting jsinterop, dev mode will also not support new jre emul (e.g. Objects.equals)
    * Against:
        * We presently don't backport fixes - only latest GWT 2 will contain fixes, and removing dev mode may discourage projects from updating
        * Maintenance costs are fairly minimal
        * Forces substantal improvements to gwt-user to take place outside of the gwt repository, as we expect to be the default in gwt 3+
    * Discussion will continue

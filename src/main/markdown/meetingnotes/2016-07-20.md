* GWT 2.8
    * Daniel did some pre-testing & smoke tests. 
    * Re-did initial tests, seems good. 
    * Candidate RC1 going into smoke testing.
    * Plan to push it out to Maven soon. 
    * Thomas ran against his local RC1, things look good. 
    * Likely results available later this week, if everything looks good, weâ€™ll publish RC1.
    * No known bugs
    * Colin: Will file bugs against documentation.
    * Need additional releases: Gin & Guava, before we make it final. Need to add this in RC1 release notes.
    * Plan to freeze master after RC1, til final.

# Creating GWT applications

The GWT framework comes with an application creator known as **webAppCreator**. This **webAppCreator** creates 
a simple Maven project with some test code. It is ready use, will launch and while running, do a RPC server call. All 
classes are located in one Maven project.

Besides the **webAppCreator** there are more application creator. Depending on your needs, this archetype creator might be 
a better choice for your needs.

## Application Creators

Here are a list of application creator. As far as we known, all of this projects are under active development.

### gwt-maven-archetypes<a id="create-third-party-tb"></a>

This archetype creator will generate a Maven based GWT project with separate modules for client-, shared- and server-code.
The server module is based on Jetty. In modern GWT development the separation of client-, shared- and server-code is the 
way to go. This archetype generator is a great place to start.

# Update Information

We will add or update information on request. 

## Request for adding Libraries to the Eco System site

The GWT eco system is a living system. New dependency will be created, other will be end of life. Also we know, that there are
much more dependency outside. If you think, one dependency not listed here is worth to be mentioned, [open an issue
on our tracker](https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt-site/issues/new/choose). This will trigger a process to get mentioned in the eco system content.

We will expect:

* The dependency must be maintained
* The dependency must be well documented
* The dependency must be deployed to Maven central
* The dependency must be an Open Source project

## Request for updating Library-Information

To update information of an already added dependency, [open an issue
on our tracker](https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt-site/issues/new/choose) containing the desired changes.

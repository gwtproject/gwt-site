# Application Frameworks 

One of the main tasks, when writing a GWT application is separating the code and managing the state. GWT offers with
[MVP Activities and Places](/doc/latest/DevGuideMvpActivitiesAndPlaces.html) modules to do that. Over the
time other implementations evolved.

Domino-mvp is a small, simple and a very lightweight framework for building both simple and complex applications using
GWT, it introduce the concept of routing using both tokens and events, also allows the developers to write a modular 
application and shared components with any other domino application.

## Nalu<a id="nalu"></a>

Nalu is a tiny framework that helps you to create GWT based applications quite easily. Using the HTML 5 history for 
routing and navigation, Nalu supports the browser's back-, forward-, and reload-button by default and without any
need to implement anything.

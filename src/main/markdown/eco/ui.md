# UI - Implementations 

GWT comes with a widget implementation. Using this, means in most cases, customizing it. Which is something that, in many cases, consumes a lot of time.
Looking for more complex widgets, usually you end up creating and maintaining them. The GWT eco system offers alternative
implementations.
